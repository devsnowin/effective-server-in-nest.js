# Node.js Concepts Learning

## Overview

In this repository, I've been exploring fundamental concepts such as the event loop, promises, concurrency, and parallel promises in Node.js. This README provides a brief overview of what I've learned so far.

## Concepts Explored

- Event Loop
  The event loop is a crucial aspect of Node.js that enables non-blocking I/O operations. It allows Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without creating threads for each request. Understanding the event loop is fundamental to writing efficient and scalable Node.js applications.

- Concurrency
  Concurrency in Node.js involves executing multiple tasks seemingly simultaneously. It is achieved through non-blocking I/O and asynchronous programming. By embracing concurrency, I can build applications that handle a large number of simultaneous connections efficiently.

- Promises
  Promises are a way to work with asynchronous code more easily. They provide a cleaner and more organized syntax for handling asynchronous operations. By grasping the concept of promises, I aim to enhance the readability and maintainability of my Node.js code.

- Parallel Promises
  Parallel promises refer to the execution of multiple promises simultaneously. This concept ties in with concurrency and is essential for optimizing the performance of Node.js applications. Mastering parallel promises can lead to more responsive and faster applications.

## Getting Started

To explore the code examples and projects related to these Node.js concepts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-concepts-learning.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nodejs-concepts
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

> Note: Make sure you have [nestjs cli](https://docs.nestjs.com/#installation) install globally.
